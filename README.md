# Employee-Tracker

## Description

This is an employee tracker that is supposed to have a database of your current employees, with there roles and salary, and department. I used inquirer, console.table, and mysql2. I used inquirer to get the prompts and mysql2 to connect the database. I created it to get better at using sql and to create a useful app.
